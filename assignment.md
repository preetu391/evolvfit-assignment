I have tried to create the design and functionalities as per Evolv Frontend Challenge as near as possible within the stipulated time.



The components added are-

->>'Data.json' contains 3 data objects containing all required fields.

->>'Dashboard.js' for creating the dashboard and for mapping contents from the 'json' file.

->>'Users.js' to show all the relevant data of the user as rows on the dashboard.

->>'Nutrition.js' and 'Workout.js' to route to nutrition and workout pages respectively for every user on clicking the buttons given besides them.

->>'Dahboard.css' and 'Users.css' to style the dashboard and user rows.



Functionalities added-

->>'Step target' and 'Calorie-target' buttons to increment/decrement their values by 500 steps and 100 calories.

->>The workout and nutrition buttons route to userId/workout and userId/nutrition pages.

->>According to the boolean feedback value the workout button changes to a red button with exclamation.

->>If the performed date and scheduled date are equal the component surrounding scheduled date turns red.
